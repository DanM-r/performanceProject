    "# Project of Performance and Experimentation Course\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a practical project involving a procedure of measurement, analysis and experimentation of systems for the purpose to find possible ways to increase performance in time or space axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea for this project is to measure the performance and the stability between linux and windows gaming for the games \"Fallout: New Vegas\" and \"Factorio\". Linux gaming has improved over the years thanks to the invention of Proton, a compatability tool created by Valve Software that allows games run on linux eventhough the game was not done for the operating system in a simple way. The protonDB page gathers reports of users of the overall stability and issues using the Proton tool. For each game it has a rating designated based on a specific criteria, the different ratings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Native: the game has a linux version which does not requires a compatability tool such as Proton\n",
    "- Platinum: runs perfectly out of the box\n",
    "- Gold: runs perfectly after tweaks\n",
    "- Silver: runs with minor issues, but generally is playable\n",
    "- Bronze: runs, but often crashes or has issues preventing from playing comfortably\n",
    "- Borked: game either won't start or is crucially unplayable\n",
    "\n",
    "For the games that are gonna be used for this experiment, \"Fallout: New Vegas\" has a gold rating and \"Factorio\" has a native rating, which means these games can be runned on the linux operating system, in the case with Fallout, it might require some tweaks in the configuration files and launch options to be able to run. The ratings for both games are provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Fallout: New Vegas](https://www.protondb.com/app/22380)\n",
    "- [Factorio](https://www.protondb.com/app/427520)\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine that's gonna be used for the experiment is a PC with the next specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 5800x\n",
    "- Memory: 32 GB DDR4\n",
    "- Storage: SSD\n",
    "- Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors that could impact performance and stability\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate which factors may play a role in the performance and stability of both games, it must be thought from a perspective of layers.\n",
